# Email_Automation_Bot_Bristi_Ghosh
This project is an intelligent assistant that accepts a user’s natural language command (e.g., “Send an internship email to Insurebuzz”) and:  - Interprets the command using AI - Interactively collects required information (like Gmail credentials and email content) - Automates the Gmail login and email sending process via simulated browser steps.
